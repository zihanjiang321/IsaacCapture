class TeleopSession:
    """High-level teleop session manager with RAII pattern.

    This class manages the complete lifecycle of a teleop session using
    Python's context manager protocol.

    The session handles:
    1. Creating OpenXR session with required extensions
    2. Creating DeviceIO session with trackers
    3. Initializing plugins
    4. Running retargeting pipeline via step() method
    5. Cleanup on exit

    Pipelines may contain leaf nodes that are DeviceIO sources (auto-polled from
    hardware trackers) and/or leaf nodes that are regular retargeters requiring
    external inputs. External inputs are provided by the caller when calling step().

        pipeline = OutputCombiner({
            "gripper_left": connected_left.output("gripper_command"),
            "gripper_right": connected_right.output("gripper_command"),

                result = session.step()
                left = result["gripper_left"][0]

    Usage with external (non-DeviceIO) inputs via ValueInput:
        controllers = ControllersSource(name="controllers")
        ee_state = ValueInput("ee_state", RobotEEState())  # external leaf
        pipeline = combiner.connect({
            "controller_left": controllers.output("controller_left"),
            "ee_pos": ee_state.output("value"),
        })

                })

    Any BaseRetargeter that is a leaf (not connected to a DeviceIO source)
