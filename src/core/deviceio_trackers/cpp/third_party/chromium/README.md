# Chromium key code table

`dom_code_data.inc` is Chromium's table of physical keys: for each key, its W3C UI Events
`KeyboardEvent.code` string and its USB HID, Linux evdev, XKB, Windows and macOS codes. The
keyboard tracker includes it to translate `KeyboardEvent.code` strings to evdev codes and back,
and the Python bindings build `EvdevKeyCode` from it, so no key list is maintained by hand.
