/**
 * Drop-in replacement for `@nvidia/cloudxr`, aliased in via webpack.app-mock.js: re-exports
 * everything from the real package except `createSession`, which is redirected to
 * {@link createMockCloudXRSession}. This lets the *real* App.tsx/CloudXRComponent.tsx run
 * against MockCloudXR without any source change - same idea as cloudxr-js's
 * examples/webpack-nvidia-cloudxr-alias.cjs (OVERRIDE_CLOUDXR_FILENAME), one level up: that
 * repo aliases an internal SDK dependency; we don't control @nvidia/cloudxr's internals, so we
 * alias the whole package entry instead.
 *
 * The most-recently-created mock session is exposed on `window.__mockCloudXRFail`, mirroring
 * cloudxr-js's `window.__cloudxrMockFail` (see src/mocks/ragnarok-mock.ts there), so a
 * Playwright test can force a mid-stream failure from outside the page. `window.__mockCloudXRConnectDelayMs`,
 * read once per `createSession()` call (before the real App.tsx ever calls `connect()`), extends
 * that pattern to hold a session in `Connecting` indefinitely - used to reproduce the
 * "passthrough-only" gap (session enters XR successfully but the stream never composites, and
 * the app has no way to tell that apart from a slow-but-fine connect).
 *
 * Imports/re-exports the real SDK's concrete entry file (`@nvidia/cloudxr/build/cloudxr.js`),
 * not the bare `'@nvidia/cloudxr'` specifier: webpack.app-mock.js aliases that bare specifier to
 * this very file, so referencing it here would self-import circularly instead of reaching the
 * real package.
