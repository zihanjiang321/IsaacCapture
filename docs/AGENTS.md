# Docs — agent notes

Rules that the docs tree cannot state for itself. Anything that describes how a page is
currently put together belongs next to it instead — in the `.rst`, in the YAML header, in
the CSS — where it moves when the code moves.

## Build the way CI does

`make current-docs` wipes `build/current` and runs `sphinx-build -W --keep-going`, which
is what CI runs, so a new warning fails the build. Check a docs change with that target
rather than a bare `sphinx-build`.

`make multi-docs` is the other half, and it constrains how extensions are written:
sphinx-multiversion builds every whitelisted ref with `-c` pointing at the checkout that
invoked it, so `app.confdir` is that checkout while `app.srcdir` is the ref being built.
Resolve paths from one of those two, never from the working directory or the repo root.

The config is therefore a site-wide input, not a per-version one: the deploy job takes
`docs/` from `main` before building, or a release or tag push renders main's pages with an
older `conf.py` and anything its extensions provide disappears. A push runs the workflow
file from its own ref, so that step has to stay alive on every release branch that still
receives pushes.

Images follow `.gitattributes` like everything else, Git LFS included. A checkout without
LFS holds pointer text and Sphinx copies it into the site verbatim, so a page that looks
right locally can still ship broken artwork. Commit artwork together with the page or data
that references it.

## Never wrap styled layout in `.. container::`

Docutils renders `container` as `class="docutils container"`, and Bootstrap claims the same
class name, so the theme ships `.docutils.container {padding-left: unset; padding-right:
unset}`. That outranks a plain class selector and silently flattens horizontal padding —
panels end up with text flush against their border. Use the `eco-block` directive, or the
`eco_block` node from Python, for any element the CSS pads.

## The docs ship no JavaScript

The docs set no `html_js_files`, and interactivity comes from platform features instead:
the device table's Details rows are one `<details>` per row sharing a `name`, and CSS alone
ties an open disclosure to its panel. Two rules generalize from that. An affordance that
would need a script does not go on the page. And where the CSS feature behind one is not
universal, the fallback reveals content rather than hiding it.

The one script lives in `source/_static/tools/supported-devices-listing-preview.html`, a
standalone form device makers fill in to see their row. It is not a docs page and no page
links to it; it loads `ecosystem.css` itself, so do not copy the table styles into it.

When docutils has no node for an element you need, give `eco_block` an `html_tag` and
`html_attributes` rather than emitting a `nodes.raw` blob, so the contents stay real nodes
for non-HTML builders.

## The external marker follows the target, not the record

The docs site and the IsaacTeleop repository are both this project, so a link into either
renders with no arrow and no screen-reader "(external)" — tracking links included. Only
third-party domains get the marker, and other GitHub organizations (`isaac-sim`) count as
third-party. `ecosystem_grid.PROJECT_REPO` is the one place that boundary is written down.

## The Ecosystem page is tables, not cards

Every section of `overview/ecosystem.rst` is a `device-matrix` table fed by
`source/_data/devices.yaml`, whose header documents the schema; the extension is
`source/_ext/ecosystem_grid.py`. The card grid that used to sit above the table was
deleted, not disabled, so "partner" is not a word to reintroduce in markup, data, or class
names — and a second data file describing companies is the shape that was removed.

That header, plus the four section dividers, is the only commentary the data file carries.
Why a row has no `since`, who cleared a contact, why a plugin is named generically — none
of it annotates the row: state it in a field the page renders, put a rule that outlives the
row in the header, and leave the rest to the commit message.

## What a company sends is copy and artwork, not a record

A logo lives in `source/_static/logos/`, is named after the company rather than the device,
and renders at the top of that row's Details panel. Every in-row position was tried first —
before the name, after it, ahead of the Details button — and each one crowded a table whose
job is to be scanned, so treat panel placement as settled.

Marketing copy has nowhere to land, and that is the boundary to hold when a company asks:
the table has no description column, so a capability claim enters `modes` only if our own
device page documents it, links belong in the Details panel, and the sentence itself is
dropped. The build keeps `company` that narrow by rejecting every field but `name`, `logo`,
and `logo_dark`.
