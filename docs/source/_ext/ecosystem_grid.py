"""Ecosystem page content, generated from ``_data/devices.yaml``.

The ``device-matrix`` directive renders one table section, ``device-count`` counts its
rows, and ``eco-block`` wraps layout. Adding an entry takes one YAML record; page
markup never changes.

Invalid records raise at build time rather than warn, because ``make current-docs``
runs ``sphinx-build -W`` and a silently dropped row is worse than a failed build.

``_static/tools/supported-devices-listing-preview.html`` rebuilds the row markup in
JavaScript for its preview, so a markup change here has to be made there too.
